# Bank Stock
Class project for Programming Methodology (Rutgers ECE)

## Context
I was required to create an Account Management System which consists of a bank account and a stock portfolio. I was given a starting balance of $10000. The program will read two text files (<i>stock2.txt</i> and <i>input.txt</i>).<i> stock2.txt</i> consists of a list of stocks and their price.<i> input.txt</i> is for command inputs. The program will then generate an output file acting as a "receipt" and for testing purposes.
